<b>Gangtok</b> is the capital and largest town of the indian state of Sikkim. Gangtok is located in the shivalik hills of the eastern himalayan range, at an altitude of 1,437 metres (4,715 ft). The town, with a population of thirty thousand belonging to different ethnicities such as nepalis, lepchas and bhutia, is administered by various departments of the government of sikkim. Nestled within higher peaks of the himalaya and enjoying a year-round mild temperate climate, gangtok is at the centre of sikkim’s tourism industry.<br>

Gangtok rose to prominence as a popular buddhist pilgrimage site after the construction of the enchey monastery in 1840. in 1894, the ruling sikkimese chogyal, thutob namgyal, transferred the capital to gangtok. in the early 20th century, gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between lhasa in tibet and cities such as kolkata (then calcutta) in british india. After india won its independence from britain in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with gangtok as its capital. in 1975, after the integration with the union of india, gangtok was made india's twenty-second state capital.<br>

<h2>History</h2><hr size=4>

Like the rest of sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.[3] The earliest records date from the construction of the hermitic gangtok monastery in 1716.Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the enchey monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of sikkim after an english conquest in mid 19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the tibetans by the british, gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between tibet and british india at the end of the 19th century.Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time.<br>

1894, Thutob namgyal, the sikkimese monarch under british rule, shifted the capital from tumlong to gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. following india's independence in 1947, sikkim became a nation-state with gangtok as its capital. Sikkim became a suzerain of india, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the chogyal and the then indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.This pact gave the indians control of external affairs on behalf of sikkimese. Trade between india and tibet continued to flourish through the nathula and jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient silk road near gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the sino-indian war in 1962, which deprived gangtok of its trading business.The nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.
