<b>Gulmarg biosphere reserves</b>
(48km.)<br>
The reserve area is located at a distance of 48-km from Srinagar, to its southwest. It is famous for retaining several rare and endangered species such as the musk deer, and a rich and varied avifauna.<br><br>

<b>Alpather lake</b>
(13km.)<br>
Beyond khilanmarg, 13-km from gulmarg at the foot of the twin 4, 511 metre apharwat peaks, this lake is frozen until mid-june and even later in the year one can see lumps of ice floating in its cold waters. The walk from gulmarg follows a well-graded pony track over the 3, 810 metre apharwat ridge, separating it from khilanmarg, and then up the valley to the lake at 3,843 metres. The more adventurous trekkers can climb straight up the boulder-strewn slope of the ridge and descend the other side to the path. for horse riding aficionados, alpather lake makes an exciting day's excursion, starting early morning and returning late evening.<br><br>

<b>Ferozpore nallah</b>
(5km.)<br>
Reached from the tangmarg road, or from the outer circular walk, this mountain stream meets the bahan river at a popular picnic spot known as 'waters meet'. The stream is reputed to be particularly good for trout fishing; it's about five km down the valley from gulmarg but quite close to tangmarg. The river can be reached by walking 3-km down the path from the gap near tangmarg and then heading south through the forest, down a slope towards the stream. Near here there is a bridge which leas to the small waters meet picnic spot on the right bank. Looking south from tangmarg the river can be traced up to its source close to the rugged peak known as ferozpore or shinmahinyu. On the right bank the stream branches, the left path leading to tosa maidan, while the right bends away towards the gogaldara road at a second bridge, about 32-km upstream, and then leads away to the ferozpore pass, poonch and kantar nag. One can continue on from here to tosa maidan, a three day, 50-km walk to one of kashmir's most beautiful marg's, crossing the basmai gali pass at about 4,000 metres. The track here is very close to the ceasefire line with pakistan and on the right one will pass the jamainwali gali, the pass at 4,000 metres is one of the easiest and safest routes into the punjab.<br><br>
<b>Khilanmarg</b>
(6km.)<br>
This smaller valley is about a 6-km walk from the gulmarg bus stop and car park. The meadow, carpeted with flowers in the spring, is the site for gulmarg's winter ski runs and offers a fine view of the surrounding peaks and over the kashmir valley. It's a 600-metre ascent from gulmarg to khilanmarg and during the early spring, as the snow melts, it can be a very muddy hour's climb up the hill. The effort is rewarded, if it's clear, with a sweeping view of the great himalayas from nanga parbat to the twin 7,100-metre peaks of nun and kun to the southeast.<br><br>
<b>shrine of baba reshi / ziarat of baba reshi</b><br>

This muslim shrine is on the slopes below gulmarg and can be reached from either gulmarg or tangmarg. The ziarat, or tomb, is of a well-known muslim saint who died here in 1480. before renouncing worldly ways he was a courtier of the kashmir king zain-ul-abidin. Every year thousands of devotees visit this shrine regardless of the faith they believe in.
<b>The ningli nallah</b>
(8km.)<br>
Flowing from the melting snow and ice on apharwat and the alpather lake, this pretty mountain stream is 8-km from gulmarg. the stream continues down into the valley below and joins the jhelum river near sopur. this long, grassy valley is a popular picnic spot and the walking path carries on, crossing the ningli (also spelt as ningle) nallah by a bridge and continues on to the khilenmarg, another grassy meadow and a good spot for camping. in early summer one will probably share the campsites with gujars moving their herds up to the high meadows.<br><br>
