Ootacamund (officially, Udagamandalam Tamil: sometimes abbreviated to udhagai tamil: or Ooty , is a town, a municipality and the district capital of the nilgiris district in the indian state of tamil nadu. Ootacamund is a popular hill station located in the nilgiri hills. Originally occupied by the todas, the area came under the rule of the east india company at the end of the 18th century. Today the town's economy is based on tourism and agriculture, with manufacturing of medicines and photographic film also present. the town is connected to the rest of india by road and rail, and its historic sites and natural beauty attract tourists.<br>

<h2><b>History</b></h2>
<hr size=4>
Ooty, which is deep within the nilgiri hills, is also known as the blue mountains. It is unknown whether this name comes from the blue smoky haze given off by the eucalyptus trees that cover the area, or because of the kurunji flower, which blooms every twelve years giving the slopes a bluish tinge.[3] unlike any other region in the country, no historical proof is found to state that ooty was a part of any kingdoms or empires. Tippu Sultan was the first to extend his border by constructing a hideout cave like structure.[6]

It was originally a tribal land and was occupied by the todas along with other tribes who coexisted through specialisation and trade. frederick price in his book ootacamund, a history states that the area which is now called as the 'Old Ooty' was originally occupied by the todas. The todas then handed over that part of the town to John Sullivan, the then governor of coimbatore. He later developed the town, and encouraged the establishment of tea, chinchona, and teak trees. Like many of the settlers, sullivan was highly impressed by the way the tribes cooperated, and sought to maintain this balance. he later campaigned tirelessly to ensure land rights and cultural recognition for these tribes and was financially and socially punished for this by the british government.<br><br>

The nilgiri territory came into possession of east india company as part of the ceded lands, held by Tippu Sultan, by the treaty of srirangapatnam in 1799. rev. jacome forico, a priest, was the first european who visited nilgiris in 1603 and released his notes about the place and the people of nilgiris. in 1812 surveyor william keys and macmohan visited the top of the plateau. In 1818, wish and kindersley, assistant and second assistant to collector of coimbatore visited this spot and submitted their experience report to the collector of coimbatore john sullivan. <br>

 Again in may 1819 he came to the hill of ooty and began the construction of his bungalow at dimbhatti (near Kotagiri), the first european dwelling on the hills. John Sullivan laid the path from sirumugai (near-mattupalayam) to dimbhatti in 1829 and the work was completed in may 1823. the route up to coonoor was laid in 1830-32. Ooty served as the summer capital of the madras presidency and other small kingdoms, much visited by british during the colonial days, and as today, a popular summer and weekend resort. soldiers were also sent here and to nearby wellington (the home of the madras regiment to this day) to recuperate. Its stunning beauty and splendid green deep valleys inspired the british to name it queen of hill stations.<br>

It is reached via winding hill roads or a complicated rack railway system, known as the Nilgiri mountain railway, built in 1908 by impassioned and enterprising british citizens with venture capital from the Madras government.<br>

<h3><b>Governance And Politics</b><br><br></h3>
<hr size=4>
Ooty is the district headquarters of the nilgiris district.Ootacamund assembly constituency is part of nilgiris (lok sabha constituency).<br><br>
<h3><b>Economy</b></h3>
<hr size=4>
Contrary to the thought that much of the local economy is now dominated by tourism, ooty is still a supply base and market town for the surrounding area which is still largely dependent on agriculture, notably the cultivation of "english vegetables" and "english fruits" grown locally. this primarily consists of potato, carrot, cabbage and cauliflower and the fruits being peaches, plums, pears and strawberries. There is a daily wholesale auction of these products at the ooty municipal market, which is one of the largest retail markets in India. dairy farming has long been present in the area and there is a cooperative dairy in ooty manufacturing cheese and skimmed milk powder. as a result of the local agricultural industry, certain research institutes are based in ooty. These include a soil conservation center, livestock farm and a potato research farm. <br>
efforts are being made to diversify the range of local crops with floriculture and sericulture being introduced in the local area, as well as the cultivation of mushrooms.<br>

Hindustan photo films, the film manufacturer, is also a major industry in ooty. This is located on the outskirts of the town at indu nagar.[12] Human biologicals institute, which manufactures human rabies vaccine is present in ooty near pudumand. Other manufacturing industries are located in the outskirts of ooty. The most significant of these are in ketti (manufacture of needles); aruvankadu (manufacture of cordite) and coonoor (manufacture of rabies vaccine). cottage industries in the area including chocolate, pickle manufacture and carpentry. Homemade chocolates are popular among the tourists and the locals.<br>

Though the local area is known for tea cultivation, this crop is no longer grown nor processed in ooty. Tea is more economically grown at slightly lower altitude and hence coonoor and kotagiri are local centres of tea cultivation and processing.<br>

<h2><b>Tourist Spots Around Ooty</b></h2><hr size=4>

Ooty is situated in the Nilgiri biosphere reserve. Many of the forested areas and water bodies are off-limits to most visitors to protect this fragile ecosystem. Some areas of the biosphere reserve have been earmarked for tourism development, and steps are being undertaken to open these areas to visitors whilst conserving the area. Much of ooty has already been damaged by rampant commercialization as a result of tourism. Some of the most prominent tourist spots around ooty are as follows:

   <br><br><b> Doddabetta Peak</b>: It is the highest peak (2,623 m) in the nilgiris, about 10 km from ooty.
