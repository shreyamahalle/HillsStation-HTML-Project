The legendary source of the river is a spout from the mouth of a statue of a cow in the ancient temple of Mahadev in old <b>Mahabaleshwar</b>. legend has it that Krishna is lord Vishnu himself as a result of a curse on the Trimurtis by Savitri. also, its tributaries venna and koyana are said to be lord shiva and lord brahma themselves.
