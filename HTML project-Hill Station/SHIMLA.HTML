<b>Shimla</b>,formerly known as <b>Simla</b>, is the capital city of Himachal Pradesh. In 1864, Shimla was declared the summer capital of the british raj in India. A popular tourist destination, shimla is often <b>referred to as the "Queen Of Hills,"</b> a term coined by the british. Located in the north-west himalayas at an average altitude of 2,205 metres (7,234 ft), the city of shimla, draped in forests of pine, rhododendron, and oak, experiences pleasant summers and cold, snowy winters. The city is famous for its buildings styled in tudorbethan and neo-gothic architecture dating from the colonial era. Shimla is connected to the city of kalka by one of the longest narrow gauge railway routes still operating in india,[2] the kalka-shimla railway. Shimla is approximately 100 km (68 miles) from Chandigarh, the nearest major city, and 365 km (226.8 miles) from new delhi, the national capital. The city is named after the goddess shyamala devi, an incarnation of the hindu goddess kali<br>
<h2>History</h2>
<hr size=4>

In 1806, Nepali king Prithvi Narayan Shah united Nepal. And many territories that are now a part of India were a part of nepal, including almora, phatankot, kumaon, garhwal, simur, dehradun, kangra, and shimla itself. Shortly later, the british east india company and nepal went to war from 1814 to 1816. At the conclusion of the war, as a result of the sugauli treaty, all these parts of nepal were ceded to the british east india company. At that time, Shimla was known for the temple of hindu goddess Shyamala devi, and not as a city as it is today.<br>
Not long after gaining possession of Shimla, the british began to develop the area. the scottish civil servant Charles Pratt Kennedy built the first british summer home in the town in 1822. Lord Amherst, the governor-general of bengal from 1823 to 1828, set up a summer camp here in 1827, when there was only one cottage in the town, and only 'half a dozen' when he left that year. There were more than a hundred cottages within ten years.[4] shimla soon caught the eye of lord william bentinck, the next governor-general of bengal from 1828 (later of India, when the title was created in 1833) to 1835. In a letter to colonel churchill in 1832, he wrote<br>
Simla is only four days March from Loodianah (Ludhiana), is easy of access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of hindoostaun (hindustan).<br>

				One of his successors, sir John Lawrence (viceroy of India 1864–1869), decided to take the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between Calcutta and a this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.[4] Lord lytton (viceroy of India 1876-1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a viceregal lodge, later built on observatory hill. a fire cleared much of the area where the native indian population lived (the "upper bazaar"), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the european town forced these to live in the middle and lower bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the ridge. The upper bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices - for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.<br>

				During the 'hot weather', Simla was also the headquarters of the commander-in-chief of the indian army and many departments of the government, as well as being the summer capital of the regional government of the Punjab. They were joined by many of the british wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed simla society, which, according to charles allen,[6] "was as close as british india ever came to having an upper crust." This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, Merchants, and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the indo-gangetic plain. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave simla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as rudyard kipling said in a letter cited by allen, it had a reputation for "frivolity, gossip and intrigue". <br>
