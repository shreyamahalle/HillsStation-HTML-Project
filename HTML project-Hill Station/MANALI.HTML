<b><h2>History</h2></b>
<hr size=4>

In ancient times, the valley was sparsely populated by nomadic hunters known as 'Rakshas'. The next arrivals were the shepherds who arrived from the kangra valley and settled to take up agriculture. Some of the earliest inhabitants of the region are the 'naur' or 'nar', which is a caste unique to the kullu valley. Only a few naur families are known to exist now. A naur family in the village soyal near haripur on the west bank of Manali was famous for the vast land they owned and their practice of having 'Rakshas' as their labourers.[citation needed]<br>

The british introduced apple trees and trout, which were not native to manali flora and fauna. It is said that when apple trees were first planted the fruits were so plentiful that often branches, unable to bear the weight, would collapse.[citation needed] to this day, apple—along with plum and pear—remains the best source of income for the majority of its inhabitants.<br>

Tourism in manali received a boost after the rise of militancy in Kashmir in the late 1980s. This once quiet village was transformed into a bustling town with many hotels and restaurants.<br>
